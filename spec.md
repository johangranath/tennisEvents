**Tennis League Management System - Developer Specification**

## 1. Overview
The Tennis League Management System is a web application designed to automate the scheduling, tracking, and ranking of seasonal tennis leagues. It supports multiple divisions playing in parallel, enforces a rotating partner doubles format, and allows an administrator to manage all league data.

## 2. Core Features
### 2.1 Admin Features
- Manage players (add, remove, rename)
- Set up seasons and divisions
- Configure match schedules based on available court times
- Enter and update match results
- View detailed rankings and match history

### 2.2 Public Features
- View schedules, match details, and rankings
- Access past season results

### 2.3 Match Format
- Doubles format (four players per match)
- Rotating partner system ensuring each player partners with every other player once
- Three-set matches with each set contributing 4 points to the total
- Games within sets tracked for game differentials

## 3. System Architecture
### 3.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js (Single Page Application)
- **Backend:** .NET Minimal API (RESTful design)
- **Database:** MongoDB (NoSQL, document-based storage)
- **Authentication:** Admin-only login with username/password

### 3.2 API Structure
- **PlayersController**: CRUD operations for players
- **SeasonsController**: Manage seasons and divisions
- **MatchesController**: Schedule and retrieve match details
- **ResultsController**: Enter and update match results
- **RankingsController**: Compute and retrieve rankings

## 4. Data Handling
### 4.1 Collections
- **Players:** ID, Name, PhoneNumber
- **Seasons:** ID, Name, StartDate, EndDate, DivisionIDs
- **Divisions:** ID, SeasonID, Name, PlayerIDs, MatchIDs
- **Matches:** ID, SeasonID, DivisionID, ScheduledDate, Team1, Team2, Result
- **MatchResults:** Set scores, game differentials

### 4.2 Scheduling Algorithm
- Auto-generates weekly matches based on court availability
- Ensures every player partners with each other once
- Assigns byes if necessary (rotational system)

## 5. Error Handling & Validation
- **Player Management:** Prevent duplicate names, validate phone numbers
- **Scheduling:** Ensure no duplicate matchups, handle odd-numbered player cases
- **Results Entry:** Validate scores, prevent editing of past locked results
- **API Responses:** Standardized JSON error responses with HTTP codes

## 6. Testing Plan
### 6.1 Unit Testing
- API endpoints using xUnit (e.g., ensuring correct match scheduling)
- MongoDB repository functions (CRUD operations, ranking calculations)

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing with frontend API calls
- Authentication flow validation

### 6.3 User Acceptance Testing
- Admin test cases: Creating seasons, entering results, managing players
- Public test cases: Viewing schedules and rankings

## 7. Deployment & Hosting
- **Hosting:** Cloud-based deployment (e.g., Azure, AWS, or DigitalOcean)
- **Database:** Managed MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- **CI/CD:** Automated builds and deployment (e.g., GitHub Actions)
